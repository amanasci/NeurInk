## Development Guidelines

### Contributing
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility unless major version bump
- All new features must include comprehensive tests
- Documentation must be updated for any API changes
- Follow existing code style and conventions

### Release Process
- Minor versions (v2.x) for new features with backward compatibility
- Patch versions (v2.x.y) for bug fixes only
- Major versions (v3.0) for breaking changes only
- Alpha/Beta releases for experimental features

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new functionality
- Integration tests for complex features
- Backward compatibility tests for all changes
- Performance regression tests for core features
