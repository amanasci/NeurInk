I want to build a web-based platform that can generate publication-quality neural network diagrams with a focus on customizability, precision, and exportability.
Core Idea:
The website should let users design, edit, and export neural network architecture diagrams that look elegant and professional for use in research papers, presentations, and documentation. It should also support a custom markup language so users can write compact descriptions of architectures and instantly generate diagrams.
Requirements
Website Architecture
Use React + TailwindCSS for frontend.
Use Node.js (Express) for backend (if required for parsing/markup).
Everything should be lightweight, fast, and responsive.
Allow both GUI-based editing (drag-and-drop nodes) and markup-based design.
Diagram Engine
Use SVG rendering as the primary format (scalable, high-quality).
Support exporting in:
SVG (default, publication-quality).
PNG/PDF (optional, via conversion).
Rendering should support:
Smooth edges, rounded corners, anti-aliasing.
Color themes (monochrome, dark mode, colored layers, etc.).
Consistent spacing and alignment for neat visuals.
Neural Network Elements
Predefined layer blocks (Conv2D, Dense, LSTM, Transformer Block, Attention, etc.).
Customizable nodes (size, color, labels, font, padding).
Connections:
Straight lines, Bezier curves, or step connections.
Auto-routing to avoid overlaps.
Customizable arrowheads (solid, dashed, weighted edges).
Grouping layers into modules (e.g., encoder/decoder blocks).
Support annotations (text boxes, math expressions via LaTeX/MathJax).
Custom Markup Language
Create a simple DSL (Domain-Specific Language), e.g.:
input size=64x64
conv filters=32 kernel=3 stride=1 activation=relu
conv filters=64 kernel=3
flatten
dense units=128 activation=relu
output units=10 activation=softmax
Parser should convert this to a structured internal graph â†’ render as diagram.
Support hierarchical grouping:
encoder {
conv filters=32 kernel=3
conv filters=64 kernel=3
}
decoder {
dense units=128
dense units=64
}
Syntax should be forgiving and user-friendly (with autocompletion hints).
GUI Features
Drag-and-drop editor for building architectures visually.
Sidebar for:
Adding layers.
Editing parameters.
Choosing styles (color, theme, font).
Real-time preview of the generated SVG.
Split-pane view: Markup Editor â†” Visual Editor (synchronized).
Output Quality
Publication-quality standards:
Clean minimalistic style.
Support for ACM/IEEE/MNRAS/ApJ-like figure standards.
Proper font handling (LaTeX-compatible export).
Ability to export diagrams with transparent backgrounds for embedding into papers.
Advanced Features (stretch goals)
Auto-layout algorithms (horizontal, vertical, radial layouts).
Versioning/history (track changes in diagrams).
Template library (common architectures: ResNet, UNet, ViT, etc.).
Collaboration mode (share diagrams with others in form of the markup language file).
Command palette (quick add layers like VS Code).
Technical Hints for Agent
Use D3.js or React Flow for graph-based visualizations.
Use Nearley.js or PEG.js for parsing the custom markup language.
Use MathJax for LaTeX annotation rendering.
Keep SVGs clean and semantic (avoid unnecessary nesting).
Ensure diagrams scale properly (adaptive grid spacing).
Optimize for performance (even 200+ layers should render smoothly).
Deliverables
A working React frontend with:
Diagram canvas.
Sidebar controls.
Split editor (GUI + Markup).
A markup parser that converts architecture text â†’ diagram structure.
Export options: SVG, PNG, PDF.
Documentation:
How to use the markup language.
How to customize themes.
How to embed diagrams in LaTeX papers.
ðŸ’¡ Goal: Build the best online tool for generating customizable, high-quality neural network diagrams that researchers will actually want to use in their papers.
